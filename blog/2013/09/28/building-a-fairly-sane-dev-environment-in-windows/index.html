<div class="entry-content"><p>I recently left a job that mandated Windows as a development
environment. Well, that&#8217;s not strictly true &#8211; they were happy enough
for me to use Linux in a VM, but that was ultimately more trouble than
it was worth.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had to dip into Windows before (having worked a job where the
server-side code was .Net), but I&#8217;ve never had to use it as a primary
dev environment. Long story short: it is <em>extremely</em> painful to use
Windows for modern web development, or any kind of development which
is not explicitly <em>for</em> Windows.</p>

<p>Here is a statement of the main problems, and the measures which can
get you at least close to a solution.</p>

<h2>Git</h2>

<p>An odd one to start with perhaps, but it has a significant impact on
the rest of the setup. There are two ways you can get a usable Git
setup working on Windows: one is to use
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>, of which more below, and one is
<a href="http://msysgit.github.io">Git for Windows</a>, otherwise known as
MSYS-Git. You can download a lightweight version of
MSYS-Git as <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Git Bash</a> &#8211; which, you
shouldn&#8217;t be surprised to hear, comes with an implementation of Bash
&#8211; but I&#8217;m going to advise getting the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=net+installer">full installer</a>. It
should become clear why.</p>

<p>MSYS-Git is quite slow; apparently the version that you can use with
Cygwin is faster, but Cygwin was too much of an overhead for my purposes.</p>

<h2>The command line</h2>

<p>Where to begin. The Windows command line is a  disaster, unless
all you need to do is change directories and open files. No grep. No
vi. No sed. The knock-on effects, on editors and other tools which rely
on these utilities, are not fun. I&#8217;d been recommended
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/clink/">clink</a>, which offers Bash-like
completion, but it&#8217;s still &#8230; the Windows command line.</p>

<p>The options, if you want Bash or something like it, are
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>, effectively a complete replacement
for the Windows command system,
<a href="https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/wiki">GoW (Gnu on Windows)</a>, a
lighter-weight port of a set of Gnu utilities, or
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS">MSYS</a>, a package similar to GoW,
intended for compiling Gnu utilities on Windows. An outside choice is
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryEshell">Eshell</a> if you&#8217;re an
Emacs user; I tried it, but found it didn&#8217;t fit well with my workflow.</p>

<p>Cygwin is a very comprehensive solution: it presumes you&#8217;re basically
going to <em>exist</em> within it, which really didn&#8217;t work for me. GoW was
nice, but didn&#8217;t play well with the Git-integrated Bash (see above),
and neither did a separate install of MSYS. For these reasons, I
suggest installing the complete MSYS-Git environment I mentioned
above: you get Git, Bash and a decent subset of the Gnu utilities, all well-integrated.</p>

<h2>A terminal emulator</h2>

<p>That this is not a solved problem should give you some idea of The
State of Things. There are two contenders, neither of which really represents an
resounding victory:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/">ConEmu</a> and
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/files/">Console2</a>. (Incidentally,
are you noticing how much of this stuff is on Google Code? And
<em>SourceForge</em> for heaven&#8217;s sake? The mind boggles). ConEmu is highly
configurable. I do not need my terminal emulator to be highly
configurable. Console2 is marginally easier to use, but pug ugly. I
went for Console2.</p>

<h2>Package management</h2>

<p>The only real game in town here is
<a href="http://chocolatey.org">Chocolatey</a>. Like most community projects in
the Windows world, it&#8217;s undermaintained and generally a bit thin, but at least
it&#8217;s there. (And no disrespect to the maintainers here: it&#8217;s numbers
I&#8217;m complaining about, not individual effort). Installs largely work;
uninstalls or upgrades often don&#8217;t. But until
<a href="https://github.com/nddrylliog/winbrew">Winbrew</a> is reliable, there we
are. I managed to get <a href="http://chocolatey.org/packages/ack">ack</a>
installed via Chocolatey, so two cheers for it, at least; all the
packages mentioned above are available too.</p>

<h2>Runtime/language version managers</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m talking about the likes of
<a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">nvm</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby">chruby</a> here. I used
<a href="https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist">Nodist</a> (because it was
available on Chocolatey and <a href="https://github.com/hakobera/nvmw">nvmw</a>
wasn&#8217;t); there&#8217;s also <a href="https://github.com/vertiginous/pik">pik</a> for
Ruby, but I couldn&#8217;t get it working.</p>

<h2>Type</h2>

<p>Call me frivolous, but I have a background in typography and I <em>cannot
stand</em> the look of type on Windows. The fault lies with the
anti-aliasing, which only works in the vertical plane; type looks
spindly and horrible, no matter how you set it up. If you&#8217;re used to
modern-looking type, as rendered on OS X or Ubuntu, and you have any
sort of sensitivity to these things, you just can&#8217;t live with it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not a total solution, but
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/mactype/">MacType</a> saved me clawing my eyes
out, at least.</p>

<h2>In summary</h2>

<p>Attempting web development on Windows feels like being thrown back in
time five years or so. I&#8217;ve touched on the main pain points, but I
can&#8217;t even remember how many, many times I had to ransack Stack
Overflow to find out why such-and-such a gem wouldn&#8217;t work properly,
or dig about in the awful Registry. How many times I restarted the
machine to be told that Windows had decided to install 127
updates. How long and often I watched the spinny blue circle while a bleedin&#8217;
<em>Explorer window</em> opened. Ubuntu, <em>in a VM</em>, was considerably faster
and more usable in every way.</p>

<p>The larger problem is that the whole experience of working on Windows
is so rotten that <em>nobody wants to fix this stuff</em>. Plenty of GitHub
issues I followed, on large, respectable repos, were
unresolved. &#8216;Windows,&#8217; said the maintainers. Won&#8217;t fix. Closed.</p>

<p>I really can&#8217;t blame them, and similarly, I can see why the
whole open-source movement is so backward on the Windows platform;
hardly anyone&#8217;s there, and community is what keeps all this going.
I hope, for the sake of the people who have to use it, that it gets
better. I won&#8217;t be hanging around to see, though.</p>
